# phthon-challenge 
## Py Me Up, Charlie!

# Task: 

In this challenge, you are tasked with creating a Python script for analyzing the financial records of your company. You will give a set of financial data called budget_data.csv. The dataset is composed of two columns: Date and Profit/Losses. (Thankfully, your company has rather lax standards for accounting so the records are simple.)

Inside your local git repository, create a directory for both of the  Python Challenges. Use folder names corresponding to the challenges: PyBank and  PyPoll.
